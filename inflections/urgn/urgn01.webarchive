treatments to address unmet needs in the field of <font style="white-space:nowrap">uro-oncology,</font> today announced updated findings from the <font style="white-space:nowrap">UGN-101</font> Phase 3 OLYMPUS Trial in patients with <font style="white-space:nowrap">low-grade</font> upper tract urothelial cancer (LG UTUC), as well as initial CR data from the <font style="white-space:nowrap">UGN-102</font> Phase 2b OPTIMA II Trial in patients with intermediate risk <font style="white-space:nowrap">low-grade</font> <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-muscle</font> invasive bladder cancer (LG NMIBC). </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Results from a final analysis of
the primary endpoint for pivotal Phase 3 OLYMPUS showed that investigational <font style="white-space:nowrap">UGN-101</font> (mitomycin gel) for instillation demonstrated a 59&nbsp;percent CR rate in patients with LG UTUC. Findings were consistent
with previously presented results. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">The final analysis of the primary endpoint showed that in the OLYMPUS <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">intent-to-treat</font></font> population, 42 of the 71 patients (59 percent) achieved a CR. <font style="white-space:nowrap">Forty-one</font> patients entered <font style="white-space:nowrap">follow-up,</font> which is
still ongoing. Durability of response was determined by Kaplan-Meier to be 89&nbsp;percent at 6 months and 84&nbsp;percent at 12 months after primary disease evaluation (PDE). The estimated median <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">time-to-recurrence</font></font> was 13.0 months. Thirty four of the 71 patients treated in the study were initially characterized by the treating physician as having endoscopically unresectable tumor at baseline. Twenty
of 34 patients (59 percent) achieved a CR at the PDE assessment and <font style="white-space:nowrap">12-month</font> durability was identical for this subgroup. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">In
OLYMPUS, the most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) included ureteral stenosis, urinary tract infection, hematuria, flank pain, dysuria, renal impairment, hydronephrosis and frequency. Most TEAEs were characterized as mild to moderate
and transient. Sixty-seven percent (48/71) of patients in the trial experienced an adverse event involving the renal/urinary tract. Of these, 23&nbsp;percent (11/48) did not require surgical intervention, 50&nbsp;percent (24/48) required temporary
ureteral stent placement, 23&nbsp;percent (11/48) required a long-term ureteral stent and 4&nbsp;percent (2/48) required nephroureterectomy. At the time of database lock, the most common Grade 3 TEAE‚Äôs included ureteral stenosis (8.5 percent),
hematuria, flank pain, and urinary tract infection (3&nbsp;percent each). There was one Grade 4 TEAE of subdural hematoma (1.4 percent). </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">‚ÄúWe are pleased that

with LG UTUC,‚Äù said Liz Barrett, President and Chief Executive Officer of UroGen. ‚ÄúWe are on track to complete our New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Q4 2019 and will be prepared for anticipated

presented interim results from the Phase 2b OPTIMA II trial of investigational <font style="white-space:nowrap">UGN-102</font> (mitomycin gel) for intravesical instillation for patients with intermediate risk LG NMIBC, defined as those with one or
two of the following criteria: multifocal disease, large tumors and rapid rates of recurrence. The <font style="white-space:nowrap">single-arm,</font> open label study trial recently completed enrollment of 62 patients at clinical sites across the
U.S. and Israel. Patients are treated with six weekly instillations of <font style="white-space:nowrap">UGN-102</font> and undergo assessment of CR (the primary endpoint) four to six weeks following the last instillation. In an interim cohort of 32

treatment in LG NMIBC. ‚ÄòIntermediate risk‚Äô patients experience what can be viewed as a form of surgical failure, and many undergo multiple surgical procedures, known as transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), to manage these
recurrences. We are encouraged by the data observed in this <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">tough-to-treat</font></font> population for whom the standard of care is really not effective,‚Äù said Mark Schoenberg,
MD, Chief Medical Officer of UroGen. ‚ÄúWhile OPTIMA II remains ongoing and a Phase 3 study is anticipated, the results presented today further support our belief that <font style="white-space:nowrap">UGN-102</font> has the potential to be an
effective treatment option for this patient population of approximately 80,000, as there are no other options for these patients aside from repetitive surgical intervention. Based on literature, these patients have a high likelihood of recurrence at
one year due to the chronicity of this disease, so we will continue to follow them and assess durability at 12 months.‚Äù </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">In the interim data from OPTIMA II,
the most common adverse events observed were dysuria, pollakiuria, fatigue, hematuria and urinary tract infection. The majority of these treatment-emergent adverse events were characterized as mild or moderate and transient. </p>
