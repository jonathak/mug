a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has informed the Company that it does not have plans to schedule an
Advisory Committee meeting in connection with its review of the Company‚Äôs New Drug Application (NDA) for lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia. The lumateperone Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date is&nbsp;December 27,
2019. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, the Company recently submitted to the FDA the results of <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-clinical</font> analyses the Company
previously announced it had agreed to conduct related to toxicology findings in animal studies. The Company believes the results of these analyses provide additional support for its position that the metabolic pathway, and the metabolites formed,
are different in animals and humans and therefore toxicity findings in animals are not relevant to humans. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">‚ÄúWe have been working diligently to
address the FDA requests for information and are optimistic that the additional <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-clinical</font> information we submitted addresses those requests,‚Äù said Dr.&nbsp;Sharon Mates, Chairman and CEO
of&nbsp;Intra-Cellular Therapies.&nbsp;‚ÄúThere is an ongoing unmet need for new treatments for schizophrenia and we look forward to continuing our work with the FDA to bring lumateperone to patients.‚Äù </p>

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Lumateperone, our lead product candidate, is a molecule that provides selective and simultaneous modulation of serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate - three
neurotransmitter pathways implicated in severe mental illness. Lumateperone is a potent serotonin <font style="white-space:nowrap">5-HT2A</font> receptor antagonist, a dopamine receptor phosphoprotein modulator (DPPM) acting as a presynaptic partial
agonist and postsynaptic antagonist at dopamine D2 receptors, a dopamine D1 receptor-dependent indirect modulator of glutamate (both NDMA and AMPA), and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.&nbsp;Lumateperone is an investigational new drug and has not
been approved for marketing for any use by the&nbsp;FDA or any other regulatory authority in any other jurisdiction.</p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>About&nbsp;Intra-Cellular
Therapies </b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Intra-Cellular Therapies&nbsp;is developing novel drugs for the treatment of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases and diseases of
the elderly, including Parkinson‚Äôs and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. The Company is developing its lead drug candidate, lumateperone (also known as <font style="white-space:nowrap">ITI-007),</font> for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder, behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia, including Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, depression and other neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Lumateperone is under review by the&nbsp;FDA&nbsp;for the treatment of schizophrenia
and is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of bipolar depression.&nbsp;Intra-Cellular Therapies&nbsp;is also utilizing its phosphodiesterase (PDE) platform and other proprietary chemistry platforms to develop drugs for the treatment of
CNS and other disorders. The lead molecule in the Company‚Äôs PDE1 portfolio, <font style="white-space:nowrap">ITI-214,</font> is in development for the treatment of symptoms associated with Parkinson‚Äôs disease and for the treatment of heart
failure. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Forward-Looking Statements </b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This news

no plans to schedule an Advisory Committee meeting; our belief that the results of the analyses conducted provide additional support for its position that those findings are not relevant to humans; our belief that the analyses conducted further
confirm that the metabolic pathway, and the metabolites formed, are different in animals and humans; our belief that the additional <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-clinical</font> information we submitted to the FDA addresses the FDA requests;

Advisory Committee meeting and the risk that any such Advisory Committee meeting will negatively impact the approval of the NDA for lumateperone; risks associated with our current and planned clinical trials; we may encounter unexpected safety or
tolerability issues with lumateperone in ongoing or future trials and other development activities; our other product candidates may not be successful or may take longer and be more costly than anticipated; product candidates that appeared promising
in earlier research and clinical trials may not demonstrate safety and/or efficacy in larger-scale or later clinical trials; our proposals with respect to the regulatory path for our product candidates may not be acceptable to the&nbsp;FDA; our
reliance on collaborative partners and other third parties for development of our product candidates; and the other risk factors </p>
